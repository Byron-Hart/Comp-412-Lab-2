Directions for building and invoking:
Since the program is in Python, it does not need to be built, just run.
Thus, executing 412alloc simply calls python to run Lab1.py with the command line arguments sent to 412alloc.

Command Line Options for 412alloc:
-h: Prints a list of valid command line arguments with descriptions of the function of each option.
-x <name>, where <name> is a valid filepath: If <name> leads to valid ILOC, performs register renaming and prints the result to standard output.
k <name>, where 3<=k<=64 and <name> is a valid filepath: If <name> leads to valid ILOC, allocates input to k registers and printsthe result to standard output.
